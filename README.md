# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

- My main motivation for completing this project was to increase my knowledge about something I'm passionate about and pursue a career in development. 
- I built this project to prove to myself I can do the work and become familiar with what we will be learning.
- This solved my limited knowledge about each of the tools used daily to complete basic and advance functions for a software developer role. 
- I learned how to use git, process and workflows, mindset towards accomplishments, and that there is so much more to learn with repitition.
